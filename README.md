# PianoBingo

A music-bingo mini-game (Based on teacher Chiang's video)

Basic Framework:

1. UI
1.1 Game setup-page, which allows users to
- define the bingo board size and wining criteria (1, 2 or 3 lines)
- create a repertoire for bingo, or
- select the criteria so that a repertoire will be generated from the existing database
  - need to provide warning when the repertoire list is not big enough
- picked number input (with a random number generator button)
- success/fail button after each round
- a selection of sample games;

2. Database
The database of the repertoire. (Labels)

Future development:
- Language packages; 
- Link music to online video;
