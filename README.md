# PianoBingo

A music-bingo mini-game (Based on teacher Chiang's video)

Basic Framework:

1. UI
1.1 Game setup-page, which allows users to
- define the bingo board size and wining criteria (1, 2 or 3 lines)
- create a repertoire for bingo, or
- select from a existing sample game
- input for picked number (with a random number generator button)
- success/fail button after each round

2. Database
The database of the repertoire, this is for future development

Future development:
- select the criteria so that a repertoire will be generated from the existing database
  - need to provide warning when the repertoire list is not big enough
- auto search the repertoire by clicking on it in youtube
